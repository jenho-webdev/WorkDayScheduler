## About The App

The simple calendar application is designed to help users organize their day by allowing them to save events for each hour of the day. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS that is powered by jQuery.

When a user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. As the user scrolls down, they are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future, making it easy for users to quickly identify upcoming events.

When a user clicks into a timeblock, they can enter an event and save it by clicking the save button for that timeblock. The text for the event is saved in local storage, so when the user refreshes the page, their saved events persist.

Overall, this simple calendar application provides users with an easy and efficient way to plan their day and keep track of important events.

    WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
    WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
    THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    WHEN I click into a timeblock

## Roadmap

- Allow user to select the total number of questions that they will be quiz on in an incremental of 10.
- Instead of using time remaining and -5sec for wrong answer as a scoring system. Develop a more robust scoring system that will scale with different number of questions set.
- Support interactive coding questions
- Include HTML and CSS questions
- support emailing result to user.
